# Multi-Moving Camera Pedestrian Tracking with a New Dataset and Global Link Model

The MMCT dataset was created by Yanting Zhang, Shuanghong Wang, Qingxiang Wang, Cairong Yan, Rui Fan. MMCT is a novel multi-moving camera tracking dataset which contains crowded scenarios, long sequence length, variant viewpoints, and shaky camera motions. Accordingly, a standardized benchmark is built for multi-moving camera tracking. With the proposed dataset and benchmark, the single camera or multi-camera tracking methods can be fairly compared in the future, which will improve the development of multi-moving camera tracking techniques. now made publicly available for research purpose only on a case-by-case basis. MMCT is serving as the technical agent for distribution of the dataset and reserves the copyright of all the images in the database. Researchers who request the MMCT dataset must sign this agreement and thereby agree to obey the restrictions listed in this document. Failure to observe the restrictions might result in access being denied for the request of the future version of the MMCT dataset and being subject to civil damages in the case of publication of images that have not been approved for release. The researchers agree to the following restrictions on using MMCT dataset: 


1. All the videos and images will be published or released in technical reports, or papers only. Any videos or 
images will never be released in commercial materials, newspapers, or other public media.
2. The dataset will not be re-distributed, published, copied, or further disseminated in any way or form 
whatsoever, whether for profit or not. This includes further distributing, copying, or disseminating to a 
different facility or organizational unit in the requesting university, organization, or company.
3. All the data in MMCT dataset can only be used for the purpose of scientific researches. The MMCT, in whole or in part, will not be used for any commercial, military and other illegal purpose in any form.
4. All technical papers, documents and reports which used the MMCT dataset should acknowledge the 
use of the database as follows: "The research in this paper used the MMCT dataset collected by Zhejiang University." 
5. A student applicant should ask his/her supervisor to sign this agreement, and send the signed agreement to 
us using a formal university email (do not use emails like ```xxx@163.com```, ```xxx@gmail.com```; otherwise the 
application will not be considered). A student applicant should also copy the application email to his/her 
supervisor while sending the agreement to us. 
6. Please send the application with signed agreement to Shuanghong Wang (2212534@mail.dhu.edu.cn) and Yanting Zhang (ytzhang@dhu.edu.cn). ```Again, a student applicant should also copy the application email to his/her supervisor while sending the agreement to us```. 
7. The final interpretation right of this agreement belongs to Donghua University and authors.

(For a student applicant, please provide your supervisorâ€™s information below and ask your supervisor to sign the 
agreement)
